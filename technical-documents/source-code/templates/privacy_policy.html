              <h2>What sort of data do we collect?</h2>

              We collect content, communications, usage, and other information
              you provide when you use the (ReConnect) network application. This
              data is stored for the purposes of usage analysis, demographic
              analysis, and recommendations such as relevant content.
              <h4>Network and connections</h4>
              We collect information about the people you are ‘connected’ with
              or ‘friends’ with and how you interact with them. This information
              is used for the purpose of statistics such as mutual friends, and
              relevant connection requests.
              <h4>Information and opinions you provide</h4>
              Occasionally, we may provide you with optional surveys asking for
              your opinion on certain parts of the (Re-Connect) platform. This
              data is stored for us to ascertain general user opinions on our
              application and hopefully amend it to fix any issues or parts of
              the platform users seem unhappy with.
              <h2>Promoting safety, integrity, and security</h2>
              We use the information we collect to verify authenticity of
              content shared from accounts and promote safety on the
