To run this Django mock polling application, navigate to the file-path of the 
outer 'mysite' folder (where the 'manage.py' file resides) from within the 
command prompt. Then simply run the command 'python manage.py runserver' 
to initialise the page.
Go to http://127.0.0.1:8000/poll/ or http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/ on your 
browser to view the webpages.

After creating this initial Django test, and researching the availability of 
Django on our chosen hosting service (AWS), we decided the lack of group
knowledge of the syntax of Django as well as the restrictions on Django 
when paired with AWS made Flask a better choice for our backend web app 
development using Python.
